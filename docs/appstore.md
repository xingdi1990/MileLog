## App Store Review Notes

```
MileLog requires Location (Always) permission to track trips in the background while the user drives. This is the core functionality of the app.

Motion & Fitness permission is used to detect driving activity via the device's accelerometer.

All data is stored locally on the device. The app has no server component and makes no network requests for user data.

To test auto-tracking:
1. Enable auto-tracking in the app
2. Grant all permissions
3. Go for a drive (or use Xcode's location simulation)
4. The app will detect driving and record the trip automatically

To test manual entry:
1. Tap the + button
2. Enter trip details
3. Save and verify it appears in the list
