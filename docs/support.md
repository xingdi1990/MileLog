## About MileLog

MileLog is a simple mileage tracking app designed for self-employed individuals, freelancers, and anyone who needs to track business miles for tax deductions. It features automatic trip detection and calculates your deduction using the IRS standard mileage rate.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Getting Started

**How do I enable automatic trip detection?**

1. Open MileLog and tap the car icon (Auto-Track tab)
2. Tap "Enable Auto-Tracking"
3. Grant the required permissions:
   - Location: Select "Always Allow" for background tracking
   - Motion & Fitness: Allow access for driving detection
4. The app will now automatically detect and record your trips

**Why does the app need "Always Allow" location permission?**

To detect trips while your phone is in your pocket or bag, MileLog needs background location access. With "While Using" permission, the app can only track when you have it open on screen, which isn't practical for mileage tracking.

**How do I add a trip manually?**

1. Tap the "+" button on the Trips tab
2. Enter the trip date
3. Enter either odometer readings (start/end) or direct distance
4. Add an optional purpose and notes
5. Tap Save

### Trip Management

**How do I classify trips as Business or Personal?**

From the Trips list, tap any unclassified trip to open it, then select Business or Personal. Or use the quick-classify view to swipe through unclassified trips.

**Can I edit a trip after saving it?**

Yes, tap any trip in the list to view and edit its details.

**How do I delete a trip?**

Swipe left on any trip in the list and tap Delete.

### Tax Deductions

**What mileage rate does MileLog use?**

MileLog uses the IRS standard mileage rate. You can view and adjust the rate in Settings. The 2026 rate is $0.70 per mile.

**How do I export my trips for tax filing?**

Go to the Summary tab to see your totals. You can view yearly summaries with total business miles and deduction amounts.

### Troubleshooting

**Auto-tracking isn't detecting my trips**

1. Check that auto-tracking is enabled (car icon should be active)
2. Verify location permission is set to "Always Allow" in iOS Settings > MileLog
3. Verify Motion & Fitness permission is enabled
4. Make sure Low Power Mode is off, as it can affect background activity

**The app shows incorrect distances**

Distance accuracy depends on GPS signal quality. Trips in areas with poor GPS (tunnels, urban canyons, parking garages) may have some variance. For important trips, you can edit the distance manually.

**I accidentally deleted a trip**

Unfortunately, deleted trips cannot be recovered. The app stores data only on your device with no cloud backup.

### Privacy & Data

**Is my data backed up?**

MileLog data is included in your iPhone backup (iCloud or computer). If you restore your phone from backup, your trips will be restored.

**How do I delete all my data?**

Uninstalling the app removes all data permanently. There is no account or cloud data to delete.
