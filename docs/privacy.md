# Privacy Policy

**Last updated: January 26, 2026**

MileLog ("the App") is designed with privacy as a fundamental principle. This policy explains what data the App accesses and how it is used.

## Summary

- All data stays on your device
- No accounts, no cloud sync
- No third-party analytics or tracking
- No data sharing with anyone
- Delete the app to remove all data

## Data We Access

### Location Data

**What:** GPS coordinates while tracking trips

**Why:** To calculate the distance traveled during trips

**How it's used:** Location data is used only to measure trip distance. The App does not store your location history or track where you go. Only the total distance traveled is saved.

**When:** Location is accessed only when auto-tracking is enabled and a trip is actively being recorded.

### Motion & Activity Data

**What:** Device motion sensors that detect driving activity

**Why:** To automatically detect when you start and stop driving

**How it's used:** Motion data is analyzed in real-time to determine if you're in a moving vehicle. This data is processed locally and never stored or transmitted.

**When:** Only when auto-tracking is enabled.

## Data Storage

All trip data is stored locally on your device using Apple's SwiftData framework. This includes:

- Trip dates
- Trip distances
- Trip categories (Business/Personal)
- Trip notes and purposes

**No data is ever transmitted off your device.** The App has no server, no cloud storage, and no network connectivity for data purposes.

## Third-Party Services

MileLog does not use:

- Analytics services
- Crash reporting services
- Advertising networks
- Any third-party SDKs that collect data

## Data Sharing

**We do not share your data with anyone.** Period.

The App has no capability to transmit your data because it simply doesn't have that functionality built in.

## Your Control

You have complete control over your data:

- **Disable auto-tracking:** Turn off automatic trip detection in Settings at any time
- **Delete individual trips:** Swipe to delete any trip from your history
- **Delete all data:** Uninstalling the app removes all stored data permanently

## Children's Privacy

MileLog does not knowingly collect any personal information. The App has no accounts, no registration, and no way to identify users.

## Changes to This Policy

If we update this privacy policy, we will post the new policy on this page and update the "Last updated" date.
